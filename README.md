# Advent of Code

This contains my implementations for advent of code.

## Day 3

Finding bitmask operations was interesting enough, as I never had much to do with those.
As I finally reached part 2, I was stumped, as I had no idea how to add that to my current code.
However, I found [this](1) reddit post, which helped me a lot in implementing this,
as the idea of simply using `removeIf` on a list was lost on me.

After that, a whole lot of refactoring could take place.
